## Design Concept
The idea for this personal portfolio website originated from a genuine need to showcase my work experience and technical skills during my job search. Rather than starting from scratch, I saw this as an opportunity to build something meaningful and long-lasting. Drawing on my prior experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aimed to create a visually elegant and user-friendly site that not only highlights my past projects but also serves as a maintainable, evolving platform for future growth. This project reflects both practical functionality and thoughtful design, making it a natural extension of my development journey.
